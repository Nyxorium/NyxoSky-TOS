    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>[App Name]</strong> is a third-party client built on the AT Protocol, providing a user interface to access accounts hosted by providers compliant with that protocol (for example, Bluesky PBC). The app itself does not operate the hosting infrastructure and is not responsible for how hosted providers manage or share your data.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Handling</h2>
    <p>
      All account and content data (posts, profiles, messages, follows, etc.) are managed by the AT Protocol and relevant services. 
      This app does not directly store or transmit your account data to any servers operated by the developer. 
      All network communication occurs directly with the hosted provider or via protocol endpoints consistent with the official AT Protocol ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      This app may collect analytics, crash reports, or usage statistics either now or in future versions.
      If such data is collected, it is solely for improving the app (or posting about milestones 🐙) and all data will be aggregated and anonymous.
    </p>

    <h2>3. External Services</h2>
    <p>
      Because all account functions rely on the hosted provider, please review your provider’s official Privacy Policy for details on how your data is handled.
      As well as BlueSky's own Privacy Policy, which can be found <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this policy or how the app works, contact:</p>
    <p>📧 <a href="mailto:email@example.com">email@example.com</a></p>

    <h2>5. Rights and Control</h2>
    <p>Your rights regarding account and content data are determined by the hosted provider you connect to and the AT Protocol as a whole. 
      Please contact your provider directly for information on accessing, correcting, or deleting your data.
    </p>
